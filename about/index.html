            <h1>About DECA!</h1>
            <p>DECA is a business club where we train students to participate in the Provincial DECA competition that is held in Toronto. In the DECA Competition, students solve business cases in one of four business clusters: Finance, Entrepenurship, Hopsitality and Tourism, or Marketing. With over 20,000 students in Ontario, DECA is incrediby competitive. Still, Lisgar always performs well. In 2017, 30 students advanced to provincials, with 10 recieving awards and 2 advancing to internationals in the US, called ICDC.</p>
            
            <p>As a club, we enrich the experiences of students by exposing them to the world of business. Every week, we teach students new business concepts from finance ratios to market trends. We also work with them to develop their communication and presentation skills critical for school, interviews, and life beyond.</p>
            
            <p>We also expose students to new opportunities in business through additional events such as the Investopedia stock challenge, where students invest 100,000$ of simulated capital into a portfolio of real stocks over four months. In 2017, we had over 25 students who participated in the contest.
