  <h1>Pigeon Hole Theory</h1>
<p class="meta">13 Oct 2017</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Today, Charles introduced the Pigeon Hole Principle, which states that if you have n+1 pigeons but only n holes, there must be at least two pigeons in one hole. While this seems like a simple problem, when coupled with other principles it can be quite challanging!</p>

<p>There are three general steps for any pigeon hole problem:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify that itâ€™s a pigeon hole problem</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A big tip is when you have two numbers which are almost divisible, but one is slightly larger than a multiple of the other (eg. 20 boxes and 51 pieces). However, pigeon hole problems are not always that easy to see.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Identify what the pigons are and what the holes are</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a critical step to avoid making mistakes, and to make the process easy. What do you have? what are you trying to find?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Solve the rest of the problem</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Often, pigeon hole problems have an additional step beyond just the principle. This can be geometry, combinatorics, number theory, or even proofs!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
