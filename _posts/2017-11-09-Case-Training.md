Provincials results are out!
Please check your DECA profile page at 2016.deca.ca for your results. It will be under regional on the left sidebar.

Congratulations to all that qualified, but even if you didn't qualify, its very important that you still come to meetings every week (especially grades 9-11) as its a team club, and you will have a step up for next year. there is a HUGE difference between competitors in their first year vs in their second year.

Today, we did another practice case, this time drawing more upon your members as a club and less on myself.  You can find the case study and notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5Of6WgQlbXg9dfZMOK9qad6MGJWKrzKhieq8pB52Wc/edit?usp=sharing)
