This week, we recieved trip forms, talked about the plan for the next four weeks, and then did some more case practices.
Forms need to be returned by next week (the 23rd) with the $380 cost for the trip to Toronto. ~80 dollars will go to DECA for registration, ~50 for bus tickets each way, and ~250 for 3 nights at a hotel. We will be staying at the Marriott, and is very close to both the Sheraton centre (where the event is taking place), and the Eaton Centre (where you can go shopping and get food).

Next week, we will begin a four-week intensive training program, where each student will prepare and present two cases to one of our wonderful judges (Myself-Charles, Mr. Mr Mok,Tyler, Henry, Emma, Michelle, and Ryan). You will be given the practice case when you come to the meeting, and you will be timed as if it is the actual event.
Be sure to come to the meeting early (Before 3:10) if you are registered to present that day, as we have a lot of people to get through and not much time. We want to get this done before christmas break! If you can't make it on the day that you are assigned, please email me [here](decalisgar@gmail.com) and you will be rescheduled. You can find the schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138hUWH8rhzKUntzUTQPb-5A6Z-9Kph-I6lieh18_VM0/edit?usp=sharing). Please log in with your OCDSB account if you can't view it.

Finally, we split into groups and practiced cases. Groups got 15 minutes to prepare, then presented to a senior member of the club within the group. Note that both in the coming weeks and the actual competition, you will only have 10 minutes to prepare. If you would like to find more training, you can go to the resources page [here](/resources)
