Congratulations to everybody who wrote the qualifier exam!
We will have the results by next week. They will appear on the left bar of your [DECA Profile](2016.deca.ca).

Today, we had a short information meeting talking about next steps and provincials. We will be staying at the Hilton for DECA, from Feb. 8-10 in Toronto. The trip will cost approximately 380 dollars, and you will get a permission form shortly. 

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email us at decalisgar@gmail.com, or to go to our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lisgarDeca).
