Hey guys! This week, Madison and Noah from the UOttawa DECA Chapter visited and gave some great tips for provincials. If you have any questions or would like to have the powerpoint, please contact me [here](decalisgar@gmail.com).

The DECA trip is going to be next week! We'll be leaving on Thursday the 8th from school at 8:30 (please arrive to school by 8:00), and returning on Saturday the 10th around 11:30. On the way back, there will be two drop offs: Barrhaven Costco and Lisgar. Remember to tell your teachers about your absence, and to be responsible for any missed work!
