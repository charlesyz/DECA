Today, we started the second round of training.
If you have any questions or need to reschedule, [email me here](decalisgar@gmail.com). You can find all of the cases that we used [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fGKpHBxXc02IyBaPkTQUkK8_97srY_pz?usp=sharing), and you can find the schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/138hUWH8rhzKUntzUTQPb-5A6Z-9Kph-I6lieh18_VM0/edit?usp=sharing). All of these documents require that you are signed in using your OCDSB account.

This week, I went over some training tips, specifically going through material that can be found on the [resources page](/resources). If you have any questions, please [email me](decalisgar.me).

See you next week for the last round of training!
