Thank you to everybody who registered for the Investopedia Stock Challenge!
We also went over training for the contest, so if you have any questions, email me at decalisgar@gmail.com.
The entry fee for investopedia is 2$, and the contest will go on for 4 months. You start with 100,000 dollars, and you can trade stocks whenver you want, provided that the markets are open.

If you did not register or know friends who want to join, as them to fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/cNHqdrVQIMKCCzaq2) and to register at [investopedia.com/simulator](investopedia.com/simulator). Then, have them come to the next meeting to pay the 2$ entry fee. Once they have paid, i will email them the game password so they can join. Happy trading!

Remember to practice for the DECA exam on the 31st of October, and be sure to come to next week's meeting as we'll be going over practice cases for the first time.
