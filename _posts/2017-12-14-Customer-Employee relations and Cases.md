Welcome to our last round of training, and congratulations to everybody for an amazing performance! I definitely saw a distinct improvement in the second round of training. Please continue to study and practice over the holidays, and you can always ask myself or Mr Mok to judge one of your cases.

Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!
I'll see you on the first week of  school, when we will be finishing up the Investopedia Challenge.
