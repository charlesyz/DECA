Today, we went over a practice case study, and gave tips. Some of you lucky club members also got to show off your improvisational skills infront of the class!

You can find the case study and notes [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uVHHLR1fSHmnm1O6zP8UenAi9WjkuXUcOlfM5TQ-D0w/edit?usp=sharing)

From this week on, we will be starting preparation for the actual provincial contest. DECA is not an easy contest, and we want our students to do the best they can. Therefore, Meeting from now on are now mandatory. If you can't make a meeting, you need to email me or contact me before hand.

In addition, the DECA Exam will be next tuesday, October 31st at 3:15. This is the only time the test is available, so make sure that you're free. If you do not write it, you will not qualify for DECA. It will be written in the computer lab in the south building (254), but if you want to bring you laptop, I would definitely recommend doing so.

Study hard!
