Hey guys!
**Final event placements are out! you can find them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e01d5OxxXmKhabS_PPe7W_NMAgcE2vaFHSZkSt-zCUk/edit#gid=1498621873)**. Do note that these placements are final,  and that we tried our best to place you in your top choice. Students that had participated previously did get priority, and the same will be the same for those of you that chose to continue with DECA in the future. There was an extremely high number of students who wanted to do team events. However, we had very limited slots for each event, and i'd like to apologise for anyone who did not get their top choice.

The DECA qualifier exam will be on October the 31st after school, so be sure to study in the upcoming weeks. We will also be starting an Investopedia Stock challenge next week after school, so make sure to come and to bring to bring friends from outside the club! Entrance will be 2 dollars per person, and there will be a cash prize for the winner!

You can find online practice tests [here](https://www.answerwrite.com/Login.aspx?ID=161)
To qualify for provincials, you're going to want to aim for a consistent **80 or above.**
I would recommend saving any questions you get wrong onto a word document, and putting a little explanation of the solution under it. A great resource for business info is [investopedia.com](investopedia.com).
