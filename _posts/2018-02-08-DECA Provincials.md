Congratulations to everyone for finishing DECA Provincials for this year!

We'll be taking next week off, then coming back to work on fundraising for next year. We have a lot of exciting projects planned
such as a sponsorship packet for local businesses and parents, as well as a bubble tea venture that will begin some time in april when the weather gets better.

For the rest of the year, we'll be moving to a Google Docs and email system in order to have more collaberation and inclusivity when working on these future ventures. If you have any questions, or would like to be added to the email list, please email me [here](decalisgar@gmail.com).

Congratulations again and thank you all for your hard work and dedication.
