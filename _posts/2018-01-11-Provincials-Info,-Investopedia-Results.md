This week, we finalized rooming arrangements and talked a bit about Provincials. Everybody attending DECA must stay with us at the Mariott, and rooms will be 4-students to a room with no mixed genders. We will be checking every evening at curfew (10:00PM), and misbehavior could have you disqualified. You can find the final rooming arrangements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHg-LdEx0g-kDhkAEuVWzr7dA7UYNCFUVD0b26OWUWQ/edit?usp=sharing ). Choice order was based on attendance in the previous weeks, and  each student could chose one person to stay with.

Remember to check out the [DECA Dress code](http://www.deca.ca/documents/DECA_Dress_Code_and_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) before exams.
